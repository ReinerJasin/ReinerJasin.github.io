            <h2>Basketball</h2>
            <p>
                For me, basketball is not just a sport. It's a lifestyle. I've learned so much things from basketball.
                Me and my team used to have 3 principles on basketball. HARDWORK, STAY FOCUS, and PLAY FOR GOD. We
                implies those principles not only on the court, but on our daily activities. Basketball also taught me
                how to work as a team, willing to sacrifice to prioritize everybody's needs before yours. Basketball
                changes me into a better person.

                    <h2>What is basketball</h2>
                    <p>
                        I know most of you know what basketball is. But, for some of you who doesn't what basketball
                        is... Basketball is a sport where 2 teams contains 5 starting lineups and 6 reserves competing
                        against the other team to get the ball inside the bucket. Short history about basketball,
                        basketball was invented in 1891 in Springfield College by Dr. James Naismith. He invented this
                        sport to keep the condition of young athletes during winter. To play a basketball, you don't
                        need a big field like football or soccer. You only need a small court, a ball, and a hoop where
                        you can shoot the ball at. Soon after being invented, Basketball got so popular and become one
                        of the most popular sport in the world.

                    <h2>How I start playing basketball</h2>
                    <p>
                        I see basketball the first time when I was in junior high school. Before I start playing
                        basketball, soccer is my most favorite sport. I didn't like basketball that much because I was
                        one of the shortest guy in my class. Playing basketball against bigger and taller person is
                        really hard for me. After I reached senior high school, I learn so much things about basketball
                        from my new coach. I found my inspiration from a short basketball player named Rajon Rondo. Even
                        though I admire LeBron James more, Rondo's game open my eyes that basketball is for everyone,
                        not only for the tall and big, but also for the short and skinny.

                    <h2>Why I love playing basketball</h2>
                    <p>
                        Basketball is a multiplayer cooperation sport. In a game of basketball, we have competition, but
                        also we have cooperation. So, only having good basketball skill never guarantees you 100%
                        winning. You will always have to build chemistry with all your teammates in order to work it out
                        together. From that experience, I met a lot of people and a lot of new friends. Shortly, I got
                        addicted to basketball game. Whenever i'm feeling good, I always want to play basketball. Even
                        though i'm on my worst mood, I always have a mindset that playing basketball will help me
                        relieve my stress.

                    <h2>What I don't like from basketball</h2>
                    <p>
                        Maybe basketball is my favorite thing to do. But that doesn't mean like everything about it.
                        Basketball is a physical game. By playing basketball, you are risking your body while improving
                        your body condition. You'll never know when will injury hits you so bad. I fell on a basketball
                        competition one time. I twisted my right ankle so bad that I couldn't walk by myself. I went to
                        school using a wheelchair. As a basketball player, went to school using wheelchair is just like
                        showing your weakness to everyone. So I decided to push myself so I can walk again. My doctor
                        said I would't be able to walk for about 3 months, but after forcing myself, I finally can walk
                        again after only a month.

                    <h2>Impact by playing basketball</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm an introvert. Playing basketball with many teammates in front of many.. many... people is
                        really hard at the first time. But my experience changed me. Now, i'm not afraid to stand in
                        front of people to show them what I got. Making the crowd cheers is always be the thing I wanna
                        do. Basketball also taught me how to be nice to another one, respect your enemy, giving out the
                        best for the people who always hold your back. Especially, being a starting lineup for my team
                        at Honda Development Basketball League, makes almost all of my schoolmates know me. Since then,
                        it becomes easier for me to get some new friends at my school.

                        made this game when we were on the first semester, that's why the game is still based on
                        console. Basically, <b>Tebak Skuy</b> contains 7 types of question which will be chosen
                        randomly. Each question has it's own unique solution. Since there is no time limit, our goal is
                        to answer as many question to get to the leaderboard. Each player has 3 lives, so if the player
                        answers 3 questions incorrectly, player will receive the lose message and the game will end.

                        instagram. By creating this campaign, I hope that all my followers can understand how dangerous
                        the massive usage of plastic is. But unfortunately, my campaign has stopped because I don't have
                        enough time managing the account.
